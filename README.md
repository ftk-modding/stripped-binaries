# For The King stripped binaries

This repository contains stripped version of For The King binaries & generated MonoMod hooks. All methods/properties/fields are made public with actual code removed. Those binaries may be used when developing mods since Mono will ignore access modifiers check during runtime if `AllowUnsafeBlocks` option is set to `true` for your project.

`Assembly-CSharp*.dll` files are Generated using [NStrip](https://github.com/BepInEx/NStrip) using following arguments:

`NStrip.exe -p -t ThrowNull .\Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll`

`NStrip.exe -p -t ThrowNull .\Assembly-CSharp.dll`

`MMHOOK_Assembly-CSharp.dll` is generated by Monomod's [RuntimeDetour](https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod/blob/master/README-RuntimeDetour.md) through [HookGenPatcher](https://github.com/harbingerofme/Bepinex.Monomod.HookGenPatcher) wrapper. You can also generate it youself directly using following arguments:

`MonoMod.RuntimeDetour.HookGen.exe --private Assembly-CSharp.dll`

Note: these binaries only includes API and DOES NOT include game logic and therefore are not DMCA-claimable.
